          I will be honest; I have been playing chess for more than 10 years and it is stressful.
		  It is sometimes hard to imporve and it is not rare to have a losing or drawing streak,<br>
		  which can be discouraging especially with the ammount of competition in the game. 
		  So why even bother playing chess? The amount of focus required is good practice <br> for 
		  other things in your life that may require immense concentration and practice. It is also
		  proven to improve intelligence, memory, and focus. It can be either just be a <br> hobby or a serious
activity. Of course, competing will require more effort and is more costly, it is fun and I recommend it if you have the time.

In every chess game, you play you are faced with challenges and problems that you have to solve 
		   in order to play your best game. Chess can help you to think ahead,<br> not rush your decisions, and weigh 
		   the pluses and minuses of your choices.
