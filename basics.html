<h2>Chess</h2>
 <p>
     You probably have known that chess existed all your life, but maybe you just remembered of its existance from the recent release of the show Queens Gambit. Although they were slightly inaccurate in the pacing of Beth's rapid growth, overall, chess was represented pretty well; even the positions played were playable variations. 
           Chess is one of the oldest games in the world dating back over 1500 years. The game of chess has evolved as it spread around the globe to the game we play today. As a result, this journey has brought people together from different cultures, ages, and backgrounds over a common bond and passion for the game. In every chess game, you play you are faced with challenges and problems that you have to solve in order to play your best game. Chess can help you to think ahead, not rush your decisions, and weigh the pluses and minuses of your choices.

           After learning what each piece does, you should probably know the ways to end a game. First off, there are a few ways you can win: You can checkmate your opponent, meaning that they're king is trapped and under check, or they resign. Second, you and your opponent can get half a point each by agreeing to a draw, or having 3 move repetition, or stalemating your opponent/getting stalemated (there are no legal moves on your turn and you are not in check). Finally, you can lose in the same ways you would win except they are done on you.
