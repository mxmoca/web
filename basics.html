           After learning what each piece does, you should probably know the ways to end a game. First off, there are a few ways you can win: You can checkmate your opponent, meaning that they're king is trapped and under check, or they resign. Second, you and your opponent can get half a point each by agreeing to a draw, or having 3 move repetition, or stalemating your opponent/getting stalemated (there are no legal moves on your turn and you are not in check). Finally, you can lose in the same ways you would win except they are done on you.
