		 Now that you have demonstrated an interest in chess, you are probably wondering who is the best at this game. Above is Magnus Carlsen, who has been world champion since 2013. Preceding him was Viswanathan Anand who is still in the top 20. You can see who is currently in the top 10 players list, as of 2021, below.

		 But where are the girls? As a female chess player myself, I will admit that chess is a male dominated sport...But girls step it up!! Some notable female chess players are Hou Yifan, Vera Menchik, Judit Polgar, Irina Krush, and current woman world chamption Ju Wenjun pictured below.(and no, Beth Harmon is a fictional character).
