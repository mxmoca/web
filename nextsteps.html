            You have now refreshed your mind on what chess is and why you should play. Now what? If you are interested in playing more and maybe even becoming competetive and entering tournaments (where you can win plastic trophies and eventually money &#129297), it would probably be best to start by practicing tactics and playing against people online. You can play online at many different time controls-ranging from 7 days per move to 10 minutes live-for free at sites such as chess.com or lichess. Tactics are also available in chess books or on sites. You could also get a coach, who can range in level or expertise and price.
